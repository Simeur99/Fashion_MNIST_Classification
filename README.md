# Fashion_MNIST_Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras in both Python and R to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to build a six-layer CNN model that can accurately predict clothing categories based on grayscale image inputs.
